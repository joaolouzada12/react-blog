# React Blog Project

This project is a simple blog application built with React.  
The main goal of this project is to **learn how to consume APIs using Axios** and to practice setting up routing with React Router.

## Features so far
- Basic React app structure
- Routing with React Router (`/` for Home and `/new` for creating a new post)
- Navbar component for navigation
- Placeholder components for pages

## What I'm learning
- How to fetch data from APIs using Axios
- How to display API data dynamically in React components
- Handling routing and layout in a SPA (Single Page Application)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joaolouzada12/react-blog-project.git
